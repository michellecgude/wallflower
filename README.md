## :seedling: (the beginnings & the motivation) :

Welcome to Wallflower. The future workings of a mental health application that's for the pre and post COVID-19 blues. If I had to describe my project in its current state, I'd refer to it as watching the trailer before the movie. Although there's nowhere near enough the functionality, styling, etc of what I want the ultimate final product to be - Its something I'm really proud of creating and designing from the ground up considering it being my introduction to programming in general. 
When thinking about the app Wallflower, and it's purpose, I like to think of it in the same vain as I introduce it in its current state:
> _It's an application meant to mend the difficulties of adjusting to a life that's made us wallflowers by chance, not choice._

We currently live in a world where social isolation almost seems like the trademark of the decade. Where Zoom chat rooms and faulty Skype calls are our new "#firstworldproblems" and simply going outside and smiling at a complete stranger feels like a new high. This application was birthed out hoping to mend that issue caused by a prickly, pointed virus. Because even when COVID-19 is long gone, the social reparations, isolation, PTSD, trauma, and dwindling social skills due to lack of communication is still going to be present. And, believe it or not, but maybe it's time we take a lesson from the "socially awkward" experts (aka, wallflowers). Because as they say...:

## :cartwheeling: user stories :
- As a user, I want a safe space I can visit to make me feel comforted in the unexpected turmoil that's COVID.
- As a user, I want to feel in control of the information I'm getting and have the choice to view COVID news or avoid it based on how I'm feeling.
- As a user, I want a simple, uncomplicated interface to input how I'm feeling that's quick to do in a fast-paced world.
- As a designer, I want the overall interface to be calming, minimal, and welcoming.
- As a millennial, I want the app to feel current to my culture.
- As a millennial, I want the app to make me feel better after I close the window.

## :bus: wire-frames :
To keep it simple and save space. 
Here's a short illustration of what they started as, and what they became over the course of the four day timeline for the project:

## :rotating_light: unsolved problems + major hurdles : 
In terms of my unsolved problems, the main things that I had to leave unsolved was really making the CSS styling perfect. Midway into almost finishing the CSS for the basic/MVP user-interface I thought, 

> _"You know what, I'm gonna throw another API in here and see if I can challenge myself at making a search bar, etc. because I'd love to eventually integrate a job search functionality with the app down the line, so, why not try something like that now?"_ 

Well, now it's pretty late (like 4am late), so, I decided to turn in everything once I got the API working. As someone who _loves_ CSS, it's a bit hard not perfecting that for the project, but, I definitely need sleep! (Although, I'm a huge night owl, so, I'll be fine). _(So, just an fyi, please excuse the wonky spacing, lack of transitions, UX/UI considerations for the interface, etc !!!)_

Biggest hurdles I honestly had (and continue to have), is making the website responsive and working well with all browser sizes, (and eventually mobile), etc. The website only currently looks perfect on my wide monitor at 100% (and my laptop at 85%). But, other than that, nothing too major in terms of difficulty.

## :rainbow: next steps, future concept (aka, i'm definitely working on this over christmas break and through the new year) : 

_will add to this later... this will contain future wireframes, concept art, formal board of the potential "brand" of wallflower. currently under construction._
